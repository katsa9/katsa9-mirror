                                    <p class="text-muted">I joined BulkSMS as a Full Stack developer. I've been involved in developing end-to-end features for their new client portal web application. I have also been responsible for developing the dynamic functionality of their new website. For the web application I have been using AngularJS, Typescript and Bootstrap on the frontend, as well as Java(Spring), the BulkSMS REST API and Perl(Mason) on the backend. For the website, I have used vanilla Javascript, HTML, CSS and Jekyll on the frontend and PHP on the backend. I have really enjoyed learning a multitude of new technologies as well as gaining valuable experience in full stack web development.  </p>

In this role I had the opportunity to perform requirements analysis as well as system design. I particularly enjoyed working as one of the leaders of a small team where we would take a feature from inception, perform ux/ui design, solution design, implementation and testing. It was rewarding to be able to drive the product and then hear that the customers loved the delivered feature. I also really enjoyed mentoring and teaching junior developers.</p>
