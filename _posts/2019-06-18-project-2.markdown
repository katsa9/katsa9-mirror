description: I have been working on the BulkSMS client portal and implemented a number of end-to-end features. To view the application you will need to create a BulkSMS account on www.bulksms.com and then navigate to the demo link above we have not officially released the new web application yet. On the website side, I have been responsible for the dynamic functionality (not the design or implementation of visual elements). Have a look at the pricing page for an example.
