description: This project is a question game application that allows you to answer as well as add questions of the form - Would you rather Fight Thanos OR Fight Voldemort. The application also has a leaderboard where users are ranked according to the sum of questions they have asked as well as answered. The application also mocks a logging in process so that it behaves correctly depending on who is logged in. The aim of this project was to practice React with Redux for state management. I also decided to include styling using Bootstrap 4.
